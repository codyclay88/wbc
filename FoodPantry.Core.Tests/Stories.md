# What are we trying to do?

Our church currently has pantry events one the 1st Wednesday of each month.

As an administrator, I need to be able to create "pantry events" that represent the dates that we will host the food pantry.
Each pantry event will define its start and end time.
Each pantry event will have a product catalog that defines the products that will be available at that pantry event.
Each pantry event will also have a list of "inventory needs" associated with it.

As an administrator, I need to be able to manage the list of products that our food pantry provides.
Products are things like "canned corn" or "peanut butter" or "toothpaste". 
Each product has a name, category, and a unit size. 
So a product might be "canned corn", "vegetable", "15 oz can", or "peanut butter", "protein", "16 oz jar".
Ideally, each product will have an associated image so that we can show a picture of the product on the website, 
and shoppers will know what to look for when they are shopping.

As a church member, I need to be able to see the current inventory needs of the food pantry.
The inventory needs are the list of products that the food pantry needs to have in stock by the next pantry event.

As an administrator, I need to be able to set a "minimum required amount" for each product that we need to have in stock for each pantry event.
As I am setting the minimum required amount for a product, I need to be able to see how much of that product we used in previous pantry events, so that I can better project how much we will need in the future.

As a church member, I need to be able to "sponsor" inventory needs. 
This means that I will commit to bringing a certain number of a product to the pantry before the next pantry event.
For example, I might commit to bringing 10 cans of corn to the next pantry event.
Once I have "sponsored" that item, it should no longer appear in the list of inventory needs.

The system should be able to track over time how many of each product is in stock at any point in time. 
This will allow our administrators to more easily determine how much of each product to order.
